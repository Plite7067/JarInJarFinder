# JarInJarFinder
Python script to find jar in jar mods.

Put the python script (`jijfinder.py`) in your mods folder. You will need Python installed on your computer.
Run the script. On Windows it should work out of the box. On Unix based systems, possibly including MacOS, you will probably need to make the file executable with `$ chmod +x jijfinder.py`.

It should create a file called `jijfiles.log`. Either look at it yourself, or send it to the person asking for it.
